# AVR Programs
These are my implementations of the example programs in the [Make: AVR Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/make-avr-programming/9781449356484/)
book. The AVR-Programming library was copied from the book's [repository](https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming).

## My Setup
I'm currently using the ATmega328P from an Arduino UNO. I use a separate Arduino Nano as ISP for programming the AVR.

If you're facing an issue of `rc=-1` error from `avrdude` while programming the ATmega328P from an Arduino, head over to
the discussion thread of [this issue](https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming/issues/24) of the book's repository.
